# Edupay

Edupay is a blockchain-powered platform built on **Lisk** and **Base** that aims to support the African education system. By leveraging stablecoins such as **USDT**, Edupay provides a transparent and efficient way for charitable organizations, donors, and individuals to pay school fees and contribute to various literacy initiatives within schools. The platform is designed to ensure that financial support reaches the students and educational programs that need it most, empowering communities and creating better educational opportunities for African youth.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Lisk and Base for decentralized, transparent, and secure financial transactions.
- **Stablecoin Payments**: Uses stablecoins (e.g., USDT) to ensure secure and stable contributions, avoiding the volatility of other cryptocurrencies.
- **Charity-Driven**: Tailored to allow charitable organizations and individuals to contribute to education causes, including paying school fees and supporting literacy initiatives.
- **Seamless User Experience**: A modern and intuitive interface powered by **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Full traceability of funds, allowing donors to see exactly how their contributions are spent and who benefits from them.
